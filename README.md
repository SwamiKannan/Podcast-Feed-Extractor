## Getting all your RSS feed addresses from your iTunes directory
This is a follow-up from my <a href="https://github.com/SwamiKannan/POD-IGY-for-Podcast-Summaries-using-Whisper-and-OpenAI"> POD-igy </a> repo.

I realized that there was no easy way to extract the RSS feeds from your podcast app. I use iTunes on my desktop for downloading my podcasts. So I created this repo that extracts the podcasts from your iTunes folder and provides you with the RSS feeds.

## Instructions:

1. Download this repo to your disk.
2. Open your command prompt and navigate to this repo
3. Enter the repo:
   ```cd Podcast-Feed-Extractor```
4.
